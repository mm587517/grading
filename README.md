# Grading Script

This script allows you to perform grading based on a rubric. You can add as many grading sections as you want, each with a specified point value. You can then deduct points from each section as needed.

The script will save your grading sections to a file so you can easily reuse them for future grading. You can also copy the grading results to your clipboard, including the total score.
## Requirements

## Installation

## Usage
